# Math Question Game

A simple math game that checks a user's ability to count fast. The user has just 3 seconds to give the correct answer.
After giving the answer, the app shows the time in which the user responded and the information whether the user
clicked on the correct number or not. Numbers and an operator are randomly drawn.
